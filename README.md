# LoginTemplate
A simple HTML Template to help get you get started with designing your Panther Web Login screen. Below is the screenshot of the completed Login screen in the Brower.  Most of the HTML  and js was generated by the Panther Migration Utility. Bootstrap libraries were used to transform  the plan screen into a modern , responsive screen .  JPL validation and sql  functionality remains the same. Some of the JPL was  rewritten in Javascript.
